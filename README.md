#### Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
A statically typed language is one in which the type of its variable is known at compile time, e.g Java, C++, C, Swift, Rust, Go, etc.

A dynamically typed language is one in which the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. e.g Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, etc.

Undefined is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. while Null is the intentional absence of the value, you can assign the value null to any variable which basically means it's blank.
